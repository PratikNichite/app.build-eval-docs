## App.build Experiment Hub ðŸ§ª
This repository is dedicated to **evaluating and experimenting** with the [app.build agent](https://github.com/appdotbuild/agent), an open-source AI agent built by Databricks that generates **production-ready full-stack applications from a single prompt**.

Our goal is to ensure the agent consistently delivers reliable, high-quality, and deployable applications.

### Important files:

#### 1. Logs:
- They live inside `data/logs` folder.
- These logs are structured, meaning for each configuration **[linter_checks, type_checks, tests_checks, sql_checks]**, there is one folder inside `data/logs`, e.g. -> data/logs/0111 (where linters are turned off). 
- Each log file is named as `prompt_[prompt_id].log`, e.g. -> prompt_1.log

#### 2. Log extraction code:
- Important to extract code out of log files.
- It lives in the root directory with the name `code.ipynb`.
- Behind the scene it uses another python script that has all the underlying code for extracting information out of log files.
- This underlying python script is named as `extract_log_data.py`.

#### 3. Prompts:
- These are the user prompts used for evaluations.
- They live in [`data/prompts.csv`](data/prompts.csv).

#### 4. Evaluation results:
- They live inside [`data/evaluations.csv`](data/evaluations.csv).
