## App.build Experiment Hub ðŸ§ª
This repository is dedicated to **evaluating and experimenting** with the [app.build agent](https://github.com/appdotbuild/agent), an open-source AI agent built by Databricks that generates **production-ready full-stack applications from a single prompt**.

Our goal is to ensure the agent consistently delivers reliable, high-quality, and deployable applications.
