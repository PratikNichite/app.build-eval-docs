1|Pratik|Create a simple web app called Plant Care Tracker that lets users track the condition of their plants using fun plant moods based on custom rule-based logic. Avoid using AI, ML, or external APIs.
2|Pratik|Make a Roommate Chore Wheel that randomly assigns chores each week and tracks completion.
3|Pratik|Build a dashboard to monitor car maintenance history and upcoming service dates.
4|Pratik|Build a simple web app that suggests if tomorrow's trip to a given city is a good idea, based on open-meteo API's weather forecast for that city.
5|Pratik|Build a currency conversion app that takes an amount, source currency and target currency as input and converts it using the Frankfurter API.
6|Dheenadayalan|Generate a Streamlit app called Movie Watchlist Manager that connects to a local SQLite database to track movies you want to watch. The app should present a form to add new entries with fields for title, director, release year, and watch status ( “Planned”, “Watching”, “Completed”), display the existing list in a table with inline Edit and Delete buttons for each row, and immediately reflect any changes by writing back to the database and reloading the table.
7|Dheenadayalan|Build a Classic Snake Game with pygame and scaffold a Python app that opens a grid‑based window, draws the snake as a series of square blocks, and lets the player steer it with the arrow keys. it should have randomized “food” that, when eaten, grows the snake’s length and increments the score shown in the corner, and should include logic to detect collisions with walls or the snake’s own body to trigger a game‑over screen with a “Press R to restart” option.
8|Dheenadayalan|Generate Brick Breaker game using Pygame. Generate a window with a movable paddle at the bottom controlled by left/right arrow keys, a grid of colored bricks at the top, and a ball that bounces off walls, paddle, and bricks. Also cover ball physics, brick‑removal on collision, level completion detection, and a simple lives counter so you can lose on a missed bounce and reset the level.
9|Dheenadayalan|Generate a Memory Card Matching Game. create a window that lays out a face‑down grid of cards (6×6), flips two cards on click to reveal their icons, and either removes matching pairs or flips them back over after a brief pause. also should include shuffling the card deck, tracking attempts, and displaying a You Win dialog when all pairs are found.
10|Dheenadayalan|Write a Flask app called\u202fJoke Collector\u202fthat integrates with the Official Joke API and a local SQLite database: on the homepage, display a list of all saved jokes (setup, punchline, optional user comment) with “Edit” and “Delete” links; include a “Fetch Random Joke” button that issues a GET to\u202fhttps://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke, inserts the returned setup and punchline into your SQLite table, flashes a success message, and redirects back to the list; clicking “Edit” loads the joke into a form where you can add or modify your personal comment and save it back to the database; clicking “Delete” removes the joke after flashing a confirmation; ensure each CRUD operation commits instantly and uses Flask’s flash messaging for user feedback.
11|Pranav|Create a web app for managing a book library where users can add, view, update, and remove books, each with details like title, author, genre, and reading status. Include user-friendly forms, list views, and the ability to search or filter books.
12|Pranav|Users input hours of sleep, stress levels, caffeine/alcohol intake—then get a daily "wellness score" with historical trends.
13|Pranav|Create a basic event tracker that lets users add, view, and delete events with a title, date, and description. Use a clean, modern UI with minimal code in your preferred framework.
14|Pranav|Build a dashboard where users log sleep, work hours, social time, screen time, and emotional energy. Visualize patterns and suggest when to take breaks.
15|Pranav|Build an app where users can add and track pantry items, get expiry notifications, and, if possible, generate recipe suggestions using AI based on available ingredients.
